When determining if the above linear model will predict the mpg of MechaCars effectivley we will have to take into account the models p-value and Multiple R squared value. The p-value of 5.35e-11 is more than sufficent as it is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05. This coupled with the fact that the multiple R-squared value or our coefficient of determination is 0.71 brings us to the conclusion that our slope is not 0, this linear model will make correct predictions approximatley 70 percent of the time, and that there is sufficent data to reject the null hypothesis therefore the model is effective. The summary above also reflects that there is a positive correlation between variables vehicle length, and ground clearence as they have higher Pr values. The variables of vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD have low Pr values which means that they provided a non random amount of variance to our dataset.
